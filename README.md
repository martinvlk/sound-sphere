# The sound-sphere project
Exploring sound-driven animated 3D graphics.

Please note this currently depends on a library that's part of another of my
projects:
[sound-level-indicator](https://github.com/martinvlk/sound-level-indicator).
For now you will need to add "sound-level-indicator" as a source dependency if
you wish to compile and run this program.
